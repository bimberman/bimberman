## 💬 About me

Hi, my name is Ben Imberman, an ardent software developer with a background in Mechanical Engineering.

When I was in high school I discovered my interest in new technologies, which led to an undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering. During my education I honed in on my interests and found that I enjoy software development. After graduation I decided to pursue a career as a full stack developer and attended a full immersion web development program at LearningFuze to accomplish that end.

I spent 3 months at LearningFuze and dedicated 10-12 hours each day learning new technologies and tools, such as JavaScript, React, Node.JS, and PostgreSQL. Following the work-like environment, grew my knowledge and expertise in software development. The program also focused on learning new technologies independently, in an efficient and effective way.

I'm currently looking for a job so if you think I would be a good fit for a position, then please get in touch!

- 💻 I’m currently learning Vue.js
- 📚 My tech stack is React.js, JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL
- 🛠 I use Bootstrap, npm, Babel, Webpack, and Slack
- 🍃 After a full day of coding, I enjoy playing D&D and other RPGs
